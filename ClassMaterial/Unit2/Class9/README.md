# Classification I: Introduction to Logistic Regression

**OBJECTIVES**:

- Differentiate between *Regression* and *Classification* problem settings
- Connect Least Squares methods to Classification through Logistic Regression
- Interpret coefficients of the model in terms of probabilities
- Discuss performance of classification model in terms of accuracy
- Understand the effect of an imbalanced target class on model performance

**Additional Resources**

- [ISLR Classification Chapter](data/ISLR_classification.pdf)
- [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8&vl=en) on Logistic Regression
- [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-la3q9d7AKQ) on Logistic Regression
